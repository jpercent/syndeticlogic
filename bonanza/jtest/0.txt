aaa lab at stanford child development and learning dominos cognitive development in school context dominos in studying out of school settings like dominoes we can see different versions of how teaching and learning occur and perhaps use these insights to improve teaching and learning in classrooms this work has been concerned with how learning occurs in a popular cultural game setting as players assist one another with game goals as well as how the nature of that assistance and learning shifts with the age of the players results have shown that peer assistance is crucial to the maintenance of the game and that players find ways to ask for and receive help that does not disturb the flow of activity and allows players to appear competent even when they don t know an answer or can t make a play older players both provide and ask for help in more sophisticated and linguistically complex ways and draw on cultural language forms that also develop as players became more experienced hence increasing problem solving ability in the game is related to changing social interaction and more complex talk we are currently exploring the nature of help seeking and help giving in more detail as well as investigating how different types of social interactions and structures eg working in collaborative or competitive pairs may help or hinder learning in the game further we are exploring the relation between domino play and the ability to solve some kinds of mathematical problems and how this effect may vary between early and upper elementary school players
aaa lab at stanford child development and learning fractions and manipulatives cognitive development in school context fractions and manipulatives students come to the learning of the ratio concept with well developed ideas about whole numbers these ideas can interfere with understanding fractions students often interpret fraction symbols like 1 3 as two separate whole numbers 1 and 3 for students to overcome these interpretations they need opportunities to reinterpret fractions working with physical materials like manipulatives can help in this regard when they work with hands on materials students take some fairly automatic actions like separating pieces collecting pieces into sets and partitioning those sets these automatic actions turn into the mathematical actions of counting grouping and collecting during these actions children develop new interpretations of the physical array they have changed we have found that the process of active reinterpretation benefits learning both in terms of immediate changes in performance and in terms of applications and learning in new settings in particular children develop three fold interpretations in which a piece can be a unit a member of a group and a member of a whole this multiple interpretation appears to be critical to the development of the ratio concept at least in the context of parts and wholes to help children develop multiple interpretations and notice the important features of ratios we have created a new manipulative called an annaboard shown in the figure the board juxtaposes different quantities that help children notice different relations among the quantities eg twice as big the children invent notational systems to characterize the differences between the quantities the tandem processes of perceptual noticing and symbolic invention prepares students to understand the significance of a conventional notation when it becomes available
aaa lab at stanford child development and learning logical reasoning cognitive development in school context scientific and logical reasoning the ability to induce an hypothesis and deduce its empirical implications constitutes hypothetico deductive reasoning research on logical reasoning hypothesis testing and induction has found that children as well as adults have difficulty in this rigorous form of scientific reasoning we are exploring whether it is possible to support and improve this reasoning by helping people visualize their hypotheses plus teach a computer agent using matrix representations who reasons based on those hypotheses for more details on the teachable agent application for this work read about moby in the teachable agents section work with teenagers has shown impressive results on reasoning posttests the current work is examining whether younger children also benefit the approach has been to let children first try to induce express and apply rules unaided if they have difficulty we demonstrate how to do it afterwards we test whether children were prepared to learn from the demonstration by giving them new problems thus far we have found that at least 4th graders can learn to reason about negation necessity sufficiency and they can work with two factors in a conjunctive relation current plans include working with even younger children as well as testing whether children who work with the teachable agent are in a good position to learn how to reason hypothetico deductively in a transfer situation involving science content

aaa lab at stanford complex instruction interactive analogies complex learning interactive analogies interactive analogies are pairs of simulations one simulation comes from a target domain like biomechanics eg a heart and the other simulation comes from an analogous domain like fluid mechanics eg a pumper fire truck in the attempt to answer specific problems students interact with each simulation and map the analogous structures in each interactive analogies provide a complementary use of analogies and simulations the weaknesses of one approach are handled by the strengths of the other for example simulations on the one hand do not always provide a causal model that students understand for example simulations of voltage do not always help students understand the idea of a drop in potential energy analogies are useful in this regard because they allow students to draw on prior knowledge from a related domain eg the difference between the fluid pressure at the top of a tank and the bottom of a tank on the other hand analogies do not provide feedback that helps students progressively map the structures between two domains for example simply telling someone that a battery is like an elevated water tank will not help most students work out the relevant similarities simulations provide useful feedback by allowing the student to test out possible relations interactive analogies may provide an excellent way to use the strengths of analogies and simulations to compensate for the weaknesses of each

aaa lab at stanford face to face interaction why two heads are better than one face to face interaction productive agency this effort is working towards the theory that a basic drive for learning is the effort after shared meaning people can make the effort through conversation and through the creation and sharing of artifacts the work builds on the philosophy of karl marx that begins with the assumption that people are builders and the most important element for realizing themselves and their society is access to the means of production as opposed to a welfare model in which the most important element is access to the end products of culture in the context of productive agency this translates into access to the means for producing shared meaning alienation occurs when people are told what meaning or products they have to make when they do not have an opportunity to share their productions to shape their environment or when they are denied feedback about the meanings that others construct from their efforts the work includes an empirical agenda that examines the conditions that affect the motivation to produce learn and share meaning both in face to face and audience level learning interactions for example we have found that novices are more likely to be productive agents when interacting with experts if they have resources that help them articulate their partial understandings so they can participate in a shared effort after meaning rather than simply listening to the expert productive agency differs from constructivism because it begins with an emphasis on producing shareable knowledge and artifacts it is also in a position to inform theories of motivation because it proposes that an important motivator is the attempt to share meaning whether in conversation or through the production of artifacts and performances the section on hobbies in the teachable agent section provides evidence in this regard
aaa lab at stanford face to face interaction contrasting cases face to face interaction contrasting cases and articulating early forms of knowledge at the early stages of learning it is often difficult for novices to express their understanding one way to help novices communicate early understanding to teachers and other experts is to use contrasting cases contrasting cases juxtapose instances that are near misses of one another for example in the figure novices need to learn to identify a breed of dog an expert can help them learn but when it comes time to identify a new instance of the same breed from a set of possibilities the novices need to work alone in one condition the learner and expert worked with single exemplars of the target breed in another condition the learner and expert worked with the exemplar plus a set of contrasting cases the results showed that the novices learned more from the expert when the contrasts were available this occurred because the novices could use the contrasts to ask questions and take more control of their learning for example if an expert said notice the curve of its nose the novice in the contrasting cases condition could say is the curve different from this other dog

aaa lab at stanford face to face interaction when two heads are better than one face to face interaction when two heads are better than one while ample work shows that groups often outperform the average individual within a group very little research has demonstrated that groups can outperform the most capable individual in the group this work is dedicated to determining the conditions that support group interaction and equally important identifying the likely ways in which a group will outperform individuals one consistent finding has been that groups spontaneously generate abstract representations more frequently than individuals do another finding has been that group functioning improves when external resources specifically contrasting cases provide support for articulating partial knowledge

aaa lab at stanford imagery complex physical imagery imagery and action complex physical imagery in everyday activity people can infer simple physical behaviors with varying degrees of accuracy people can infer behavior for situations as various as colliding jellyfish a water balloon hitting a bat and the flexing of a candy bar the figure shows an example of a problem that people can solve through imagery aided by physical action that they cannot solve by verbal reflection there are two glasses of equal height filled to equal levels of water the only difference is their diameter the question participants have to answer is whether the two glasses of water start to spill at the same or different angle of tilt and if one spills sooner which one when asked to solve the problem verbally about 10 of people give the correct answer however if participants tilt the glasses they are invariably correct this is true even when participants eyes are closed and the glasses have no water a line indicates the water level and participants need to imagine the water it is also true for children as young as 5 years old in this work we develop evidence that these inferences can take place through spatial imagery at the same time we gather evidence indicating the role of physical knowledge in determining the specific spatial solutions that subjects deploy when people need to infer how one object responds to the action of another there is a problem of coordination in imagery people need to coordinate the behaviors of two objects this raises the question of how people integrate general spatial knowledge and processes with more domain specific or context sensitive knowledge several lines of work demonstrate people's ability to commit physical imagery and have helped to develop a time based object oriented computational model of physical imagery
aaa lab at stanford imagery and action tool use imagery and action tool use a distinctively human talent is the construction and use of multi part tools the purpose of this work is to explore the competencies that may be responsible during tool use objects often change position for example when a wrench turns a bolt imagery may help people anticipate the displacements that result from tool use the literature on imagery points to this possibility but it has primarily explored the functions of imagery for recognizing objects and spatial arrays displaced by an experimenter for imagery to enable tool use it should also exhibit functions that specifically link the updating of an image to an individual's actions it should also help people imagine how similar actions with different tools yield different physical changes our claim is that people's actions facilitate their imagery for object displacements but that this facilitation depends on their mental model of the tool at hand for example we have found that after looking at a block and spool and closing their eyes pulling the string shown in the figure below helps people imagine the block turning clockwise as compared to not pulling the string however it interferes with their ability to imagine the block turning counter clockwise unless they think the string is unwinding from the near side of the spool
aaa lab at stanford imagery and action visual realism imagery and action visual realism research on picture perception and picture based problem solving has generally considered the information that enables one to see and think about a picture's subject matter however people often reason about a picture or representation as the referent itself the question addressed in this work is whether pictorial features themselves help determine when one reasons about the referent of an image as with an engrossing movie versus when one reasons about the image in its own right as with abstract art several different studies have compared adult and children's reasoning about physical situations ranging from gears and hinges to ratios of juice concentration a consistent finding has been that when a picture is relatively schematic and impoverished people tend to reason by making static comparisons of geometric features however when a picture is photo realistic people tend to reason about physical changes often through perceptual simulation among other things the results demonstrate that researchers must be cautious when generalizing from reasoning about diagrammatic materials to reasoning about the referents themselves

aaa lab at stanford teachable agents moby teachable agents moby moby has been designed to help students learn science content in the context of hypothetico deductive reasoning students attempt to induce the factors that regulate the appearance or non appearance of a particular outcome test their hypothesis against evil moby and then teach good moby who tests the rule in a game against an evil moby up to two factors or their negation may be necessary and or sufficient and in an and or or relationship in the current example we use flowers teachers and instructional designers however can easily add domain specific science content resources and images through a simple menu system this figure shows the basic interface students use to induce an underlying rule students click on factors to the right to overlay them on the flower grid the panel in the middle is for taking notes students drag specific results into the columns of always sometimes and never once students believe they have induced the correct hypothesis they can play against evil moby themselves before they teach good moby a new grid appears and they try to out predict where the flowers will be given the factors or where the factors will be given the flowers the games help students think about and test the logical implications of their rule in both directions the feedback helps students check their rules against confirming and falsifying evidence students have multiple opportunities to induce any given rule and play the games once students believe they know the rule they teach good moby the next figure shows two ways that students can teach moby they can use pull down menus to make a logical assertion in this case shade & sun are necessary they can also use a 2x2 table and specify whether the cells always sometimes or never have flowers when students use both controlled by the system moby checks the two versions against one another and provides graduated prompts when they do not match afterwards moby uses the rule to play prediction games against evil moby and students can evaluate their formal rule when applied consistently moby supports progressive sequencing of levels so that science ideas can be introduced over the course of a unit at the end of the unit moby will have a body of knowledge about the conditions for various outcomes a next step in our development of moby is to make it so he knows when to apply which rule in the meantime we have tested moby in high school and elementary classrooms and found meaningful gains in the ability to induce relations draw implications about likely outcomes and translate between different forms of logical expression we have also found that using the interface for teaching plus the independent performance of good moby improves student learning compared to simply playing the game and recording a rule with the interface with no implications for how an agent will subsequently perform in the future to download a version of moby click here windows only sorry the following is a brief description of how to use moby description in the city there are flowers moby wants to learn which factor s influence whether flowers will grow you need to learn the rule and teach moby phase i learn the rule start on level 1 overlay the factors one by one on the flower map to find the rule at first you will need only one factor later the rule may involve two factors phase ii play evil moby when you think you know the rule play a game against evil moby click on you on the menu bar highlight play game 1 click on the factor s to help you guess where the flowers will be click on a square to guess the presence or absence of a flower on that square to guess that a flower will not appear select guess absence from the right hand tool bar evil moby will guess and then it is your turn again phase iii teach moby when you think you know the rule teach moby click on moby in the menu bar select teach me from the drop down menu use the teaching menus to tell moby the rule when you are satisfied click ok moby will use what you have taught him to play against evil moby if moby wins by 3 points or more you have passed the level and can move on if moby loses you can try to teach him again to move on click levels to play a new game at a level click new rule authoring moby it is possible to create new content for moby teachers can tailor moby to their specific classes to author content go to the file menu the options and steps should be self evident

aaa lab at stanford transfer basketball and statistics transfer and learning basketball and statistics an important issue is the extent to which cultural forms regulate transfer or the lack thereof in prior work on learning in the context of basketball dr nasir has explored the role of culture through participation in cultural practices on mathematics learning early research in this area examined the ways mathematics learning was woven into the practice of basketball and compared players and non players solutions to average and percent problems in both basketball and school contexts findings revealed that players were better able to solve mathematics problems in the context of school further players solved these problems using different strategies than non players instead of using conventional formulas they tended to create their own systems for estimation this work illustrated that in the context of a cultural practice like basketball young people even those who may not be doing well in school math can and do learn mathematics the next set of studies explores the role of identity in these performance differences across contexts high school basketball players in two contrasting schools were observed both as they participated and learned in the context of basketball and in school math the focus for analysis was how players some of whom were successful in school math and others who were less successful constructed identities as basketball players and as mathematics students and how their learning was related to those identities results are currently being analyzed but are beginning to show important differences in how players who are successful students negotiate across environments than those who are less successful as well as consequential differences in the ways schools support student identities for players
aaa lab at stanford transfer fractions transfer and learning fractions often times instruction provides scaffolds that help students learn to perform some task the canonical example might be the use of training wheels that help children complete the task of riding a bicycle without having to master all the elements of balance a different issue is how can we help people to self scaffold when they leave the confines of our instruction people have to continue learning and the ability to use the social and physical environment to scaffold this learning is relatively unexplored in our work on children learning about fractions we have been exploring the relation between initial scaffolding and subsequent abilities to self scaffold students learned to do fraction addition with two kinds of manipulatives pie pieces and tile pieces we found that while both groups of students looked good on initial learning the tile students were much more prepared to learn in a new situation in the new situation they received new manipulatives eg beans and cups to help learn to solve new problems we knew they had to learn with the new materials because we separated those who could solve the problems in their head and those who could not the tile students were able to use the new materials to help them learn in contrast students who had learned with pie pieces reverted back to whole number interpretations of new materials in the figure the accuracy drops over the days because the children were doing increasingly complicated problems the important comparison is between the tile and pie conditions this finding highlights the importance of assessing the effects of instruction on people's abilities to continue to learn the differences between instruction with tiles and pies would not have been evident had we only looked at the children's immediate problem solving and had not assessed ability to use new resources to help themselves learn

untitled document on the twin risk in autism hallmayer j glasson ej bower c petterson b croen l grether j risch n department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences stanford university school of medicine palo alto ca 94304 usa abstract am j hum genet 2002 oct 71 4 941 6 epub 2002 sep 12 findings findings from twin and family studies are the strongest evidence that autism is genetically influenced however as of yet no gene or genes have been found that conclusively cause a higher risk of developing the disorder some studies indicate that being a twin is a strong risk factor for autism that is there appears to be an increased rate of autism in twin pairs other studies have not supported this to investigate this dr hallmayer and his colleagues examined normal children born between 1980 and 1995 and those with autism asperger syndrome or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pdd nos from their epidemiological study in australia of the 465 children with a diagnosis 13 were twin births a rate of 30 per 1000 this was compared with 9640 twin births from 386637 normal births a rate weighed to the number of children with a disorder of 26.3 per 1000 conclusions these data do not support the theory that being a twin per se is a substantial risk factor in causing autism this finding supports other recent large population based studies in california and sweden the higher proportion of twins in the affected group can be explained by the fact that identical monozygotic twins as opposed to non twin siblings have high rates of concordance the rate of twins in the affected group is also influence by the proportion of families with more than one child in the population

quadrature methods 2.7 time based integration of the equations of motion this section is under construction stay tuned although much may be said from the solutions to the linearized equations of motion in many cases we are interested in the nonlinear response the linearized expressions are very convenient for initial control law design but the full nonlinear equations are often integrated in the time domain to verify that the response of a system to large disturbances such as gusts are acceptable nonlinear simulation is also valuable for systems with strongly nonlinear characteristics in a region of the flight envelope in these cases numerical integration of the system of ode's is undertaken just how this is done may be very important to obtaining useful results issues in the numerical integration include the following choice of the basic integration scheme order update rule selection of the time step or adaptation method methods for presenting results incorporation of pilot or sensor inputs inclusion of flight control software and or hardware selection of the appropriate degrees of freedom to be included environment modeling turbulence gusts runway roughness many different methods for integrating the equations of motion for aerospace vehicles are in common use runge kutta methods are very common for all kinds of numerical integration and are frequently used in simulation but other methods such second order adams bashforth methods are popular for real time simulation
untitled 4 aerodynamic fundamentals this chapter deals with some basic concepts in aerodynamic analysis that are of particular interest in constructing models for simulation and control despite the widespread use of nonlinear cfd methods for aerodynamic analysis we will rely strongly on linear aerodynamics analysis here for several reasons although several aerodynamic features may require high fidelity computations eg shock boundary layer interaction linear analysis codes are surprisingly good at predicting the integrated flow quantities such as the forces and moments as described earlier we are forced to simplify the aerodynamic model often linearly anyway thus information from a very detailed nonlinear model may be ignored even if it were available although the field equations for fluid flow may be linearized the boundary conditions and force equations are not thus one may obtain fundamentally nonlinear effects such as the angle of attack dependence of clb even from a linear code most of the important physical phenomena are reflected in the simplified analysis allowing us to develop some insight and a qualitative view of the important physical effects finally the methods are fast and do not require great expertise in the development of a computational model so we can analyze a dozen designs in the course of a quarter this chapter will deal with some of these classical aerodynamic models and their application to the following cases airfoils and wings bodies of revolution interactions and wakes controls unsteady effects summary of derivative estimation
finite wing theory finite wing theory this section deals with several aspects of wing theory from the development of theoretical models of the finite wing to simple computational methods general theory wing model concepts computational models
full potential equation full potential equation the full potential equation is derived from the assumption of irrotational flow and the equations of continuity and momentum the pressure and density terms in the euler equations can be combined when use is made of the perfect gas law and the isentropic relation between pressure and density ashley and landahl show how we may derive the following vector form of the unsteady full potential equation this may be simplified for the case of steady flow in 2 d to about the notation when flow is irrotational curl v 0 and by definition of curl and gradient curl grad f 0 where f is a scalar field thus we can define a nonphysical scalar potential f that describes the velocity field f is related to the velocities by the relation v grad f the equations can thus be written in terms of the unknown scalar rather than the 3 components of the velocity this simplifies their solution in the above expressions a is the local speed of sound x is the streamwise coordinate and v is the vector velocity subscripts denote partial derivatives with respect to the subscripted variables eg u x du dx mach contours yellow high dark green low from tranair analysis of a 747 200 at mach 0.84 from nas technical summaries 1994 multipoint aerodynamic design forrester t johnson boeing commercial airplane group
reynolds averaged navier stokes equations reynolds averaged navier stokes equations one of the most popular simplifications made to the navier stokes equations is reynolds averaging this simplification to the full navier stokes equations involves taking time averages of the velocity terms in the equations writing u u u v v v etc where represents a time average with the fluctuations having zero mean value u 0 we have u 2 u 2 u 2 uv u v u v this allows us to write the time averaged ns equations as and similarly for the y and z components this looks just like the more general navier stokes equations for incompressible flow which hold for steady laminar flow except that there are additional terms that act as additional stresses on the right hand side these terms represent the effect of turbulence on the mean flow they are called reynolds stresses and are sometimes said to be caused by eddy viscosity these terms are generally much larger than the normal viscous terms the business of predicting these stresses and relating them to the computed mean flow properties is called turbulence modeling this is usually accomplished empirically or by using the results of detailed time dependent simulations reynolds averaged ns solvers are appropriate for the analysis of viscous compressible flows and have been applied to rather general configurations but one must be careful that the assumptions of the turbulence model are compatible with the characteristics of the flow of interest from nas technical summaries high lift configuration cfd karlin roth nasa ames research center this may not be so clear but after some manipulation of the equations it does work out see schlichting pgs 557 562 note that for steady laminar flow we do not have these extra terms they are caused by small scale unsteadiness associated with turbulence

airfoil design airfoil design outline of this chapter the chapter is divided into several sections the first of these consist of an introduction to airfoils some history and basic ideas the latter sections deal with simple results that relate the airfoil geometry to its basic aerodynamic characteristics the latter sections deal with the process of airfoil design history and development airfoil geometry pressure distributions relation between cp and performance relating geometry and cp design methods and objectives some typical design problems airfoil design program
high lift airfoil design high lift airfoil design to produce high lift coefficients we require very negative pressures on the upper surface of the airfoil the limit to this suction may be associated with compressibility effects or may be imposed by the requirement that the boundary layer be capable of negotiating the resulting adverse pressure recovery it may be shown that to maximize lift starting from a specified recovery height and location it is best to keep the boundary layer on the verge of separation such distributions are shown below for a re of 5 million note the difference between laminar and turbulent results the thickest section at re 10 million is 57 thick but of course it will separate suddenly with any angle of attack for maximum airfoil lift the best recovery location is chosen and the airfoil is made very thin so that the lower surface produces maximum lift as well since the upper surface cp is specified increasing thickness only reduces the lower surface pressures well almost if the upper surface cp is more negative than 3.0 the perturbation velocity is greater than freestream which means for a thin section the lower surface flow is upstream this would cause separation and the maximum lift is achieved with an upper surface velocity just over 2u and a bit of thickness to keep the lower surface near stagnation pressure a more detailed discussion of this topic may be found in the section on high lift systems this conclusion described by liebeck is easily derived if stratford's criterion or the laminar boundary layer method of thwaites is used for other turbulent boundary layer criteria the conclusion is not at all obvious and indeed some have suggested kroo and morris that this is not the case
interactive airfoil analysis interactive airfoil analysis introduction the program built into this page allows you to experiment with the effect of airfoil shape and angle of attack on the pressure distribution instructions click on the top part of the plot to increase the angle of attack clicking on the lower portion reduces alpha drag the handles shown on the upper or lower surfaces to modify the shape of the section and watch the effects on c p suggested exercises change the airfoil thickness and note the effect on upper and lower surface pressures notice how thickness affects the c p at the trailing edge create a pressure peak near the nose on the upper or lower side by changing the angle of attack change the camber near the nose to remove the pressure peak try to create a positive pitching moment section a very thin highly cambered section and a symmetrical section technical details this program uses a combination of thin airfoil theory and conformal mapping to very quickly compute pressures on an airfoil a method like this was used in the 1950's to compute airfoil pressure distributions before java was invented the section shape is very simple as well upper and lower surfaces consist of a quadratic in sqrt x and a quadratic in 1 x patched together at the control points this provides just 4 degrees of freedom but does lead to curves that look like airfoils
laminar airfoil design laminar airfoil design laminar flow may be useful for reducing skin friction drag increasing maximum lift or reducing heat transfer it may be achieved without too much work at low reynolds numbers by maintaining a smooth surface and using an airfoil with a favorable pressure gradient the section below shows how the pressures may be tailored to achieve long runs of laminar flow on upper and or lower surfaces again the stratford like pressure recovery is helpful in achieving the maximum run of favorable gradient on either upper or lower surfaces
low cm airfoil design low moment airfoil design when the airfoil pitching moment is constrained it is not always possible to carry lift as far back on the airfoil as desired such situations arise in the design of sections for tailless aircraft helicopter rotor blades and even sails kites and giant pterosaurs the airfoil shown here is a liebeck section designed to perform well at low reynolds numbers with a positive c m0 its performance is not bad but it is clearly inferior in c lmax when compared to other sections without a c m constraint c lmax 1.35 vs 1.60 for conventional sections at re 500000 the thickest section at re 10 million is 57 thick but of course it will separate suddenly with any angle of attack
low reynolds number airfoil design low reynolds number airfoil design low reynolds numbers make the problem of airfoil design difficult because the boundary layer is much less capable of handling an adverse pressure gradient without separation thus very low reynolds number designs do not have severe pressure gradients and the maximum lift capability is restricted low reynolds number airfoil designs are cursed with the problem of too much laminar flow it is sometimes difficult to assure that the boundary layer is turbulent over the steepest pressure recovery regions laminar separation bubbles are common and unless properly stabilized can lead to excessive drag and low maximum lift at very low reynolds numbers most or all of the boundary layer is laminar under such conditions the boundary layer can handle only gradual pressure recovery based on the expressions for laminar separation one finds that an all laminar section can generate a c l of about 0.4 or achieve a thickness of about 7.5 try this with panda
interactive airfoil design interactive airfoil design this page lets you select and modify a family of airfoils to suit the specific needs of your aircraft specify the section t c and type 0 is a conventional peaky section 1 is a rather aggressive supercritical section the resulting pressure distribution is shown below the parameter xt c lets you force transition to turbulent flow at the indicated chordwise position setting xt c 1.0 corresponds to free transition while setting it to a small value such as 0.05 forces mostly turbulent flow hints change angle of attack by either entering a value or by clicking on the angle of attack displayed on the plot holding down shift while clicking reduces alpha you may also change scale by clicking on the c p axis labels also note that you may modify the airfoil shape by clicking on the upper or lower surface to add thickness near the point where you have clicked hold down the shift key while clicking to remove thickness the boundary layer computations indicate transition to turbulent flow t laminar separation ls or turbulent separation ts if you change parameters click recompute to enter these values but note that the airfoil is regenerated as well based on the specified section type and t c
thick airfoil design thick airfoil design the difficulty with thick airfoils is that the minimum pressure is decreased due to thickness this results in a more severe adverse pressure gradient and the need to start recovery sooner if the maximum thickness point is specified the section with maximum thickness must recover from a given point with the steepest possible gradient this is just the sort of problem addressed by liebeck in connection with maximum lift the thickest possible section has a boundary layer just on the verge of separation throughout the recovery the thickest section at re 10 million is 57 thick but of course it will separate suddenly with any angle of attack

effect of sweep on supersonic section drag effect of sweep on supersonic section drag consider an infinite swept wing operating at a freestream mach number of m as shown here the normal mach number is m m cos l the effective section lift coefficient is c l c l cos 2 l and the normal thickness ratio is t c t c cos l based on 2 d linear supersonic theory the section drag is given by c d 16 3 t c 2 m 2 1 1 2 c l 2 m 2 1 1 2 4 the streamwise drag is then c d c d cos 3 l if we specify a value of c d of about 0020 and an overall c l of 0.0 we can compute the allowable t c as a function of sweep this is shown in the plot below for a mach number of 1.8 the plot shows the streamwise and normal t c allowed based on this 2d and simple sweep theory note that in this case the streamwise t c drops monotonically and the normal t c has a maximum but the variation is not as large as we might expect over the large range of sweeps this allows us to estimate that over the parts of the wing with this sweep often outer wing panels we might tolerate airfoils with t c's of 2.5 to 2.8 measured in the perpendicular direction the result is sensitive to the values we pick for c l and allowable c d based on typical overall supersonic aircraft drag which might be in the range of 012 120 counts we have at this point just chosen 20 counts for wing volume wave drag rather arbitrarily we do know however that 10 counts is probably unrealistic and 40 would have a dramatic effect on overall drag if we do the calculation at a higher c l we should allow a higher overall drag level the following plot shows another sample case for initial design purposes a reasonable choice might be to look at an allowable drag increment of 0020 at a c l of 0.0 because the wing lift dependent drag is affected by the overall wing planform but it is interesting to look at other c l s as well

form factor for bodies form factor for bodies the fineness ratio of the fuselage affects the fuselage drag by increasing the local velocities and creating a pressure drag the increase in skin friction due to higher than freestream velocities can be estimated by considering the symmetric flow around a body of revolution for bodies of revolution the increase in surface velocity due to thickness is smaller than for 2 d shapes from potential flow theory the maximum velocity over an ellipse with thickness ratio t c is du max u 0 t c the maximum velocity increase on an ellipsoid of revolution is given by the potential flow solution du max u 0 a 2 a 1 m 2 0.5 where a 2 1 m 2 d 2 d 3 tanh 1 d d and d 1 1 m 2 d 2 0.5 and d diameter length the actual surface velocity distribution depends strongly on the shape of the body paraboloids have about half again as much maximum perturbation velocities as ellipsoids and fuselages with constant cross sections are quite different but the idea here is to represent the correct trend theoretically and then obtain empirical constants if a sort of average perturbation velocity is represented by c du max then the form factor k for bodies may be written k 1 c du max u 0 2 the figure below shows that a factor c 2.3 leads to reasonable agreement with the purely empirical method given by shevell at supersonic speeds the optimum body shape is closer to a paraboliod but the velocity distribution is quite different the maximum velocity no longer occurs at the middle of the body and the flow is decelerated over more of the area in fact based on linear theory the net form factor is 1.0 form factor calculation this calculator may be used to compute the form factor for a body of revolution fineness ratio mach k

fuselage effect on induced drag fuselage effect on induced drag one may estimate the drag associated with fuselage interference in the following manner if the flow were axially symmetric and the fuselage were long then mass conservation leads to b 2 b 2 d 2 for minimum drag with fixed lift the downwash in the far wake should be constant so the wake vorticity is just like that associated with an elliptical wing with no fuselage of span b the lift on the wing fuselage system is computable from the far field vorticity so the span efficiency is e 1 d 2 b 2 in practice one does not achieve this much lift on the fuselage assuming a long circular fuselage and computing the lift based on images the resulting induced drag increment is about twice the simple theoretical value so s 1 2 d 2 b 2
control surface gap drag control surface gap drag the parasite drag also includes extra drag due to gaps at the control surfaces this is best estimated based on experimental data the drag depends on the detailed design of the controls but for the purposes of this course we take the drag increment to be f gaps 0002 cos 2 sweep s affected where s affected is the area of the wing horizontal tail or vertical tail affected by control surfaces this is typically about 0.3 s wing 1.0 s horiz and 0.9 s vert but the detailed layout should be used the correction for sweep is included since the component of the dynamic pressure normal to the gap is the significant term
wave drag due to lift wave drag due to lift the expression given for wave drag due to lift holds for wings of very low aspect ratio a more general expression is derived by rt jones in minimum drag of airfoils at supersonic speeds j of aero sciences dec 1952 the combined vortex and wave drag may be written this expression approaches the correct limits for ellipses as m 1 and as ar 0 or infinity the assumption here is that the lift distribution is elliptical in all directions an assumption that is not realized exactly in practice jones also gives an expression for the wave drag due to lift for a yawed ellipse showing that there is an optimum sweep angle at m 1.4 a 10 1 yawed ellipse at 55 has less than 1 2 of the wave drag of the ellipse with 0 or 90 of yaw when the planform shape is not elliptical it may be better to form an equivalent ellipse with the same area and length rather than one with the same aspect ratio as the real wing in this case here s is the wing area and l is the overall length this choice preserves the average wing pressure difference and agrees well with experimental data for well designed supersonic wings supersonic drag due to lift computed by present method and boeing optimization results
form factor for lifting surfaces form factor for lifting surfaces the principal cause of increased drag is the increased surface velocity supervelocity due to thickness this may be computed as follows for wing like surfaces consider an infinite swept wing with a perturbation due to thickness of ignoring the reduction in c f due to reynolds number and mach number changes associated with the increased local velocity because this cannot be computed at all well and because c f varies weakly with these k 1 2 du cosl du 2 1 5 cos 2 l 2 now in incompressible flow du c t c even for large t c with t c measured in the normal direction in 2 d subsonic flow du c t c cosl 1 m n 2 0.5 c t c cosl b so k 1 2 c t c cos 2 l b c 2 cos 2 l t c 2 1 5 cos 2 l 2 b 2 the value of k is given in the next figure and compared with other methods and experimental data a value for c of about 1.1 agrees best with the rather scattered data when m cosl 1 there is not a velocity increase due to t c and so we take c 0 form factor calculation this calculator may be used to compute the form factor for a lifting surface t c mach sweep k
nacelle base drag nacelle base drag among the many items that are included in an explicit manner one usually estimates the drag increment associated with a small gap between the engine nozzle and the nacelle nacelle base drag is a small item but is representative of the types of drag components that one tries to model in a realistic manner most turbofan engines maintain a gap between the engine nozzle and nacelle of about 1 2 inch flow separates and creates a base drag area that may be estimated as the base area 5 inch times the circumference at the nozzle exit multiplied by a drag coefficient of about 0.2 so c d nacelle_base 0.5 12 p d exit 0.2 s ref with the nozzle exit diameter measured in feet
parasite drag parasite drag the parasite drag of a typical airplane in the cruise configuration consists primarily of the skin friction roughness and pressure drag of the major components there is usually some additional parasite drag due to such things as fuselage upsweep control surface gaps base areas and other extraneous items since most of the elements that make up the total parasite drag are dependent on reynolds number and since some are dependent on mach number it is necessary to specify the conditions under which the parasite drag is to be evaluated in the method of these notes the conditions selected are the mach number and the reynolds number corresponding to the flight condition of interest the basic parasite drag area for airfoil and body shapes can be computed from the following expression f kc f s wet where the skin friction coefficient c f which is based on the exposed wetted area includes the effects of roughness and the form factor k accounts for the effects of both supervelocities and pressure drag s wet is the total wetted area of the body or surface computation of the overall parasite drag requires that we compute the drag area of each of the major components fuselage wing nacelles and pylons and tail surfaces and then evaluate the additional parasite drag components described above we thus write c d p s k i c f i s wet i s ref c dupsweep c dgap c dnac_base c dmisc where the first term includes skin friction and pressure drag at zero lift of the major components c f i is the average skin friction coefficient for a rough plate with transition at flight reynolds number equivalent roughness is determined from flight test data these computations are divided into evaluation of the following terms skin friction coefficient c f form factor k wetted area s wet control surface gap drag aft fuselage upsweep drag nacelle base drag miscellaneous items

supersonic drag supersonic drag as the mach number increases further the drag associated with compressibility continues to increase for most commercial aircraft this limits the economically feasible speed if one is willing to pay the price for the drag associated with shock waves one can increase the flight speed to mach numbers for which the above analysis is not appropriate in supersonic flow an aircraft has lift and volume dependent wave drag in addition to the viscous friction and vortex drag terms this approximate expression was derived by rt jones sears and haack for the minimum drag of a supersonic body with fixed lift span length and volume the expression holds for low aspect ratio surfaces notice that unlike the subsonic case the supersonic drag depends strongly on the airplane length l this section describes some of the approaches to computing supersonic wave drag components including wave drag due to volume wave drag due to lift program for computing wing wave drag

wetted area calculations wetted area calculations in order to compute the skin friction drag it is necessary to multiply this coefficient by the wetted area for wing like surfaces the wetted area is related to the exposed planform area it is a bit more than twice the exposed area because the arc length over the upper and lower surfaces is a bit longer than the chord the exposed area is that portion of the wing planform that is exposed to the airflow it does not include the part of the wing buried in the fuselage but does include any chord extensions for bodies the wetted area can be computed by adding the contribution of the nose section constant section and tapered tail cone this requires knowledge of the actual fuselage shape but for typical transport aircraft the wetted area of the nose and tail cone may be approximated by where d is the diameter of the constant section and l is the length of the nose or tail cone for elliptically shaped fuselage cross sections of width w and height h an approximate formula for the perimeter may be used to estimate an effective diameter one such expression is given below d eff w 2 h 2 64 3 r 4 64 16 r 2 where r hw h w
fuselage layout cabin layout and fuselage geometry the design of the fuselage is based on payload requirements aerodynamics and structures the overall dimensions of the fuselage affect the drag through several factors fuselages with smaller fineness ratios have less wetted area to enclose a given volume but more wetted area when the diameter and length of the cabin are fixed the higher reynolds number and increased tail length generally lead to improved aerodynamics for long thin fuselages at the expense of structural weight selection of the best layout requires a detailed study of these trade offs but to start the design process something must be chosen this is generally done by selecting a value not too different from existing aircraft with similar requirements for which such a detailed study has presumably been done in the absence of such guidance one selects an initial layout that satisfies the payload requirements the following sections are divided into several parts the selection of cabin cross section dimensions determination of fuselage length and shape far's related to fuselage design and seating and finally considerations related to supersonic aircraft for some examples of interior and exterior fuselage geometries see the drawings on boeing's site currently at http www boeing com commercial airports plan_manuals html

supersonic aircraft fuselage design additional considerations for supersonic aircraft additional considerations for supersonic aircraft at supersonic speeds the shape and dimensions of the fuselage have a strong effect on the aircraft drag supersonic wave drag increases quickly as the fuselage volume increases and the fineness ratio is reduced for this reason the cabin diameter is kept as small as possible and the cabin length increased the figure below shows a aerospatiale design for the fuselage of a mach 2.0 transport avion de transport supersonique futur atsf note that the diameter and seat layout is similar to the md 80 but the fuselage is much longer the concorde diameter of 113 inches is very small because of the strong impact of fuselage diameter on wave drag the requirement for a high overall fineness ratio is reflected in the fuselage geometries shown below for comparison a boeing design for a high speed civil transport is shown below note that the boeing design has a fuselage whose diameter varies over the cabin section this is done to reduce the interference wave drag between wing and fuselage this was not done on the concorde as it was felt that the increase in production costs would be too high indeed the variable cross section introduces many difficulties and affects the seating arrangement as shown below the supersonic business jet represents a somewhat less ambitious entry into commercial supersonic flight since supersonic wave drag depends on volume the motivation for a smaller cabin cross section is greater and high fineness ratios are required the drawings below illustrate the fuselage and cabin design for a supersonic business jet by reno aeronautical corporation

birdflight as the basis of aviation birdflight as the basis of aviation lilienthal's book is full of interesting comments such as this one from the introduction with each advent of spring when the air is alive with innumerable happy creatures when the storks on their arrival at their old northern resorts fold up the imposing flying apparatus which has carried them thousands of miles lay back their heads and announce their arrival by joyously rattling their beaks when the swallows have made their entry and hurry through our streets and pass our windows in sailing flight when the lark appears as a dot in the ether and manifests its joy of existence by its song then a certain desire takes possession of man he longs to soar upward and to glide free as the bird over smiling fields leafy woods and mirror like lakes and so enjoy the varying landscape as fully as only a bird can do in addition to his romantic view of aeronautics otto lilienthal was a careful observer of nature an innovative scientist practical engineer and determined experimenter his observations of bird twist and camber distributions instrumented experiments to compute lift and drag and flight tests of many glider configurations helped to transform aerodynamics into a serious field of inquiry at the end of the 19th century

aircraft structures aircraft structures why worry about structures structural design is of critical importance to aircraft safety but also plays a key role in aircraft cost and performance the airplane cost is related to the structural design in complex ways but typically aircraft end up costing $200 $500 per pound with sailplanes and military aircraft such as the b 2 demonstrating the spread in this figure the b 2 reportedly costs more per ounce than gold in addition to its direct impact on aircraft cost the aircraft structural weight affects performance every pound of airplane structure means one less pound of fuel when the take off weight is specified so in the range equation r v c l d ln w initial w final one might think of the first term representing the role of propulsion the second term aerodynamics and the third term structures in order to estimate the aircraft cost and empty weight we must estimate the weight of each of the components to do this we need to understand how these components structure is sized and to do this we need to estimate the loads that they will have to support this chapter is divided into three main sections which deal with each of these issues starting with a section on load prediction including placard diagrams and vn diagrams the chapter continues with a discussion of structural design including structural concepts critical design constraints and sizing methods the final section involves a conceptual design level method for estimating component weights and cg s

about lift and cl distributions about lift and cl distributions the distribution of lift on the wing affects the wing performance in many ways the lift per unit length l y may be plotted from the wing root to the tip as shown below in this case the distribution is roughly elliptical in general the lift goes to zero at the wing tip the area under the curve is the total lift the section lift coefficient is related to the section lift by so that if we know the lift distribution and the planform shape we can find the cl distribution the lift and lift coefficient distributions are directly related by the chord distribution here are some examples the lift and cl distributions can be divided into so called basic and additional lift distributions this division allows one to examine the lift distributions at a couple of angles of attack and to infer the lift distribution at all other angles this is especially useful in the process of wing design the distribution of lift can be written here the distributions la and lb are the wing lift distributions with no twist at cl 1 and with unit twist at zero lift respectively the first term cl la is called the additional lift it is the lift distribution that is added by increasing the total wing lift theta lb is called the basic lift distribution and is the lift distribution at zero lift why is this useful consider the following example we can use the data at these two angles of attack to learn a great deal about the wing from the expression above or the additional lift distribution cl la may be interpreted graphically as shown below the additional lift coefficient distribution at cl 1.0 is plotted below note that it rises upward toward the tip this is indicative of a wing with a very low taper ratio or a wing with sweep back the basic lift distribution is negative near the tip implying that the wing has washout
wing lift distributions wing lift distributions as in the design of airfoil sections it is easier to relate the wing geometry to its performance through the intermediary of the lift distribution wing design often proceeds by selecting a desirable wing lift distribution and then finding the geometry that achieves this distribution in this section we describe the lift and lift coefficient distributions and relate these to the wing geometry and performance about wing lift and c l distributions relating wing geometry and lift distribution lift distributions and performance

the page 1 the iames s mcdonnell distinguished university professorship of aerospace engineering princeton university page 2 page 3 antony jameson james s mcdonnell distinguished university professor of aerospace engineering i i traditionally we ve designed airplanes a bit like we did cathedrals hundreds of years ago observes antony jameson james s mcdonnell distinguished university professor of aerospace engineering back then if you wanted to build a bigger dome on a cathedral you had no way of precisely calculating what the load forces were going to be so you did it by experiment essentially by building the bigger dome and seeing how it performed under the stresses of wind and weight until recently dr jameson explains aircraft too were designed almost entirely by experiment rather than calculation it has long been possible he adds to use fairly simple equations to answer basic questions about a plane's structure how much wing surface is needed to lift a given load for example but calculating how a particular wing shape performs near sonic speeds remained beyond the reach of conventional mathematics when designing an airliner or other highly sophisticated airplane engineers relied on the time honored as well as time consuming and expensive practice of wind tunnel testing this began to change in the late 1960s with the advent of high speed computers tony jameson who was an engineer at the grumman aerospace corporation at the time has been in on this development since its beginning today he is widely recognized for his pioneering advances in creating computer models that simulate the highly complex aerodynamics of an aircraft as it approaches the speed of sound in 1986 he and princeton colleague timothy parker unveiled a program allowing aircraft designers for the first time to create accurate computer models for simulating transonic flow across an entire airplane in terms of both time and money the program promises significant savings by enabling engineers to substitute computer models for wind tunnel tests particularly in the early and middle phases of design the modeler's art is to bring aerodynamic experiments within the range of a computer's capacity by reducing them to what dr jameson calls mathematical approximations of their essential features while making the model simple enough for the computer to handle however the designer must keep it sufficiently complex to produce meaningful answers it's actually a quite deep intellectual question says dr jameson born and raised in england he received his ba and ph d from cambridge and worked six years at grumman before accepting in 1972 a joint appointment at the courant institute of mathematical sciences and new york university he came to princeton in 1980 and two years later was named one of the four original incumbents of the newly created mcdonnell professorships dr jameson enjoys academic life because it allows him to pursue some of the more theoretical aspects of computational aerodynamics at the same time he feels it is important to stay in touch with the practical problems faced by aerospace engineers i have very close ties with industry in part because iworked there for a number of years says dr jameson who would like to see more opportunities for exchange between industry and academia unfortunately once you re in industry it's very hard to get back into university life universities are places where you establish your intellectual competence and where you re judged by what you publish in industry on the other hand engineers concern themselves with solving practical problems and they usually don t publish the results of their research are treated as trade secrets this is a definite paradox he adds and it concerns me seriously ibelieve strongly that experience in industry makes one a more effective teacher while industrial engineers could benefit from the kind of organized intellectual analysis that's characteristic of the best university research page 4 six distinguished university professorships were established at princeton by gifts from the james s mcdonnell foundation of st louis they honor the late james s mcdonnell a pioneering aircraft designer and founder of the company that became mcdonnell douglas corporation mr mcdonnell received his bachelor s degree in physics from princeton in 1921 the six professorships in computer science economics engineering physics politics and psychol0gy reflect the breadth of both his professional interests and intellectual curiosity april 1987

the boeing airplanes that have benefited from antony jameson's cfd technology the boeing airplanes that have benefited from antony jameson's cfd technology 1 paul e rubbert 2 over the span of professor jameson's career computational fluid dynamics cfd has advanced from a very primitive technology to one that has emerged as a dominant tool in aerodynamic design it has changed the way by which airplanes are designed many of those advances were propelled by the understanding the algorithm technology and the codes that were created by antony jameson today the knowledge and the technology that he has created is known and utilized throughout the world one key element that underlies his continuing position of eminence is his outstanding ability to work problems right to solve the challenging problems in ways that are most practical useful and highly valued the right word is elegant but within the broad perspective of the airplane design community that is the only ante that lets one into the game the other key element that allows one to be a winner at the game is the ability to work the right problems to have the perception and understanding that guides one to work on those problems whose solutions will have the largest impact in this respect jameson's track record is truly uncanny he developed full potential solvers at the time when hardware advances and the perspective of airplane companies had advanced to the point where such technology would be accepted and used the same is true of his development of euler solvers of navier stokes technology and of his recent work on optimization methodology along the way he also made many many algorithm improvements that increased the accuracy and reliability of accuracy of cfd and which reduced the cost and cycle time of performing cfd based airplane design work each of those developments served to increase the effectiveness of cfd and to enlarge its contribution to the process of designing airplanes antony jameson has become a legend within the boeing company not only within the ranks of research and design engineering but also within the ranks of management up through the hallways and offices of the executive suite he has made his mark with them through his many contributions to the processes of designing airplanes and through exposure at countless quarterly reviews over the years wherein jameson's technology and codes are regularly presented as the core technology that underlies many of the new cfd capabilities that are reported in those reviews it is in recognition of those many contributions that the boeing company on the occasion of his 60th birthday presents to antony jameson a model displaying the many boeing airplanes whose aerodynamics design was carried out with the aid of cfd technology and codes developed by him the list of those airplanes begins with the boeing 767 designed in the late 1970s that was followed by the 757 the 747 400 the new boeing 777 and the recentlyannounced boeing 737 700 which embodies a new wing and other advanced features each of those airplanes is displayed on the model within the spirit of modern airplane design practice the model also contains room for growth there is one model position reserved for a future boeing 787 airplane and another for a 797 those airplanes are presently only a gleam in our eye but when they are designed and built they undoubtedly also will contain the imprint of jameson's computational methodology the plaque on the model reads presented to antony jameson by the boeing company on the occasion of his 60th birthday and in recognition of the cfd capabilities he created that were utilized in the aerodynamic design of these boeing airplanes a photographs of the model appears below 1 a pdf version of this article is also available pdf 2 boeing commercial airplane group seattle washington 98124 2207 frontiers of computational fluid dynamics 1994 editors david a caughey and mohamed m hafez copyright 1994 john wiley & sons ltd

genetic algorithms in aircraft preliminary design a role for genetic algorithms in aircraft preliminary design in recent years the aircraft design group at stanford has successfully applied gradient based optimizers to a variety of aeronautical design problems unfortunately these methods cannot be applied to problems with discrete variables or discontinuous objective and constraint functions because gradients are not defined in these domains furthermore gradient based optimizers must start with a specific parameterization of the design and are limited to finding optimal values of the chosen design variables standard genetic algorithms are known to be effective in multi modal and non smooth domains where calculus based methods are ineffective modification of the basic algorithm to allow variation of the parameter set during optimization has produced a method that is very suitable for use in topological design studies this approach allows the identification of successful features in simple designs described by few variables which can then be included in designs of greater complexity this capability is particularly attractive for synthesis studies because it is similar to the process used by designers in wing design for example parameters such as wing area and span are generally determined before the airfoil sections are chosen a number of design tasks that are not easily solved by gradient based optimization have been successfully handled by the new genetic method although this work culminated in the thesis of dr peter gage we continue to work with ga's for a number of problems the figure below shows the performance of a new ga on a 4 d wood's problem peetah leland stanford edu peter gage

the lindbergh project flights the flights 1927 early in the morning on may 20 1927 charles a lindbergh took off in the spirit of st louis from roosevelt field near new york city flying northeast along the coast he was sighted later in the day flying over nova scotia and newfoundland from st johns newfoundland he headed out over the atlantic using only a magnetic compass his airspeed indicator and luck to navigate toward ireland the flight had captured the imagination of the american public like few events in history citizens waited nervously by their radios listening for news of the flight when lindbergh was seen crossing the irish coast the world cheered and eagerly anticipated his arrival in paris a frenzied crowd of more than 100000 people gathered at le bourget field to greet him when he landed less than 34 hours after his departure from new york lindbergh became the first person to fly solo across the atlantic ocean 1997 seventy years later on an early may morning in 1997 a small pilot less airplane called the atlantic navigator will take off from an airfield near new york city and follow lindbergh's historic route across the atlantic television crews and newspaper reporters will be on hand to record the takeoff and will follow the flight as it progresses the airplane will be flown by a computer guided by modern electronic navigation equipment pictures and data collected by sensors on the airplane will be relayed by satellite and made available within seconds to the general public through the world wide web grade school students will see the same views that lindbergh must have seen during his famous flight seventy years earlier when theatlantic navigator lands near paris in the early evening 35 hours after departing new york it will become the first pilotless airplane to fly across the atlantic home introduction project team enabling technologies getting involved
the lindbergh project introduction the lindbergh project introduction in may of 1927 charles lindbergh became the first person to fly solo across the atlantic ocean seventy years later in may of 1997 a small computer controlled airplane designed by a team of stanford university scientists and industrial affiliates will follow lindbergh's historic route from new york to paris becoming the first unpiloted airplane to fly across a major ocean the lindbergh project's goal is to focus public attention on aviation science and technology and thereby promote greater understanding of these issues schools museums and the general public are invited to join us in this aviation adventure through the lindbergh project's world wide web site students can learn about the project and related educational topics web pages dealing with aerodynamics aircraft design and the physics of flight will be complemented by historical pages describing important events in aviation history and related world affairs biographical pages will highlight lindbergh's many achievements in areas ranging from aviation to international relations to medical technology by drawing on the colorful imagery of charles lindbergh an american hero we hope to inspire enthusiasm for technical subjects and to highlight lindbergh's personal integrity courage and ingenuity the winners of a nationwide essay contest will be published on the web site and a special section for educators will provide curriculum material for lessons in science and technology we plan to provide continuous updates on the project's technical progress through the web site prior to the trans atlantic crossing web pages will contain construction photos of the airplane descriptions of its systems and summaries of flight test results during the flight the site will display the airplane's current position and altitude as well as near real time images recorded by an onboard digital camera home project team the flights enabling technologies getting involved
maple seeds on mars single winged autorotating aerodynamic brake for martian atmospheric entry abstract this research program investigates the feasibility of a single winged autorotating aircraft for delivering sensor payloads to the surface of mars the work consists of vehicle sizing stability analysis and computer simulation of the atmospheric entry the possibility of flight testing scaled models in the earth's atmosphere will also be investigated the work is being conducted by ilan kroo and stephen morris of the stanford department of aeronautics and astronautics and larry lemke of nasa ames research center background in a proposed mars exploration mission various sensor packages will be deployed from orbit onto the planet's surface deployment schemes under consideration include parachutes and surface penetrators another delivery mechanism is autorotation such as is used by the winged seeds of maple trees a single winged autorotating device has the advantage of minimal complexity no moving parts to fail during deployment and compact storage such a system also offers an unobscured view of the sky during descent which may be important for the sensor payload currently the dynamics of single winged autorotating devices is poorly understood few papers have been written on the subject and the mechanism for transition from free fall to autorotation has not been studied in detail computer simulations written at stanford university by stephen morris have successfully modelled the transition from free fall to autorotation in the earth's atmosphere and provide a useful starting point for designing an autorotating entry vehicle for mars objectives and anticipated results the principal objectives of the work are determine the appropriate vehicle size for acceptable descent speed in the martian atmosphere determine the mass distribution and planform shape that results in rapid transition to stable autorotation investigate the possibility of a dynamically scaled model that could be tested in earth's atmosphere approach a simplified aerodynamic analysis of steady state autorotation based on local blade airfoil properties and simple momentum models is used to size the vehicle transition to autorotation and stability is being studied using a six degree of freedom nonlinear simulation coupled with the derived aerodynamics model blade shape parameters are adjusted to meet the required descent rates with a stable vehicle the vehicles pertinent dimensionless parameters tip mach number reynolds number dimensionless inertia etc will be studied to see if a useful test may be conducted in the earth's atmosphere fwing leland stanford edu steve morris

nonplanar wings closed systems examples closed systems the aerodynamics of nonplanar wing systems that form closed loops are very interesting such configurations include box planes ring wings joined wings and spiroid tip devices wings that form closed loops such as the ring wing illustrated below do not eliminate the tip vortices or trailing vortex wakes even though the wing has no tips still the vortex drag of the circular ring wing is just 50 that of a planar wing with the same span and total lift and the concept has been studied at several organizations including early aviation pioneers a major aircraft manufacturer as well as several toy companies the lockheed box plane shown below achieves even greater drag reduction at a given span and height than the circular ring wing in fact the theoretical minimum vortex drag in a configuration with reasonable high speed performance note the desirable transonic area ruling and some structural advantages fuel volume landing gear integration cl max penalties and lower section reynolds numbers are some of the disadvantages for this concept early attempts at ring wing design were just as ambitious and successful the figure below is the bleriot iii the recently patented spiroid wing tip produces a reduction in induced drag much like that of a winglet however its closed planform shape may make it possible to reduce local lift coefficientsnoften a problem for winglets although a closed lifting system may eliminate the wing tips it does not eliminate the trailing vortex wake in fact the lift produced by the system can be directly related to the velocities in the wake that lead to induced drag these systems are still interesting because one may add a constant circulation vortex ring to the system without changing the wake such a constant strength vortex distribution does not add any lift but it may be used to produce moments without induced drag penalties or to manipulate section lift coefficients in a desirable way
nonplanar wings conclusions conclusions a look at nonplanar wing concepts suggests that such configurations do offer potential performance benefits this is especially true when the concept is fully exploited by resizing or even redesigning the aircraft in addition to reductions in vortex drag some of configurations mentioned here have desirable effects on structures stability and control characteristics vortex wake hazards and other practical considerations the split tip design demonstrates that by manipulating the wake shape as well as the wing shape some of the advantages of nonplanar wings may be obtained even with planar wings and the possible applications of this idea warrant further study the c wing configuration remains an intriguing design concept with many beneficial characteristics when applied to a large aircraft design the implications of this approach remain to be more fully explored postscript the direct application of these concepts to an existing aircraft are less than overwhelming as illustrated in the figure below if a 20 reduction in vortex drag were achieved by an existing airplane and the airlines passed the savings on to the customers directly we would see a very modest reduction in ticket price about $3 on a $300 ticket although this savings would have major implications for airline profitability most passengers would not be impressed by the savings if the concept is used to redesign the airplane as in the c wing example here not only is the savings increased but an otherwise infeasible design may become feasible the direct insensitivity of ticket price to drag might be exploited as shown below by redesigning an aircraft with fixed payload capacity but with twice the floor space for each passenger the fare would have to be increased by about $30 on a $300 ticket see note this is very reasonable but might still be unacceptable in the highly elastic commercial transportation market nonetheless it is my hope that advances in aerodynamics and other disciplines can be employed to do more than just marginally lower the cost of air transportation but rather improve its safety and comfort
c wing configuration the c wing a novel nonplanar wing configuration from the survey of nonplanar wing geometries discussed previously one is struck by the fact that one need not produce a closed system such as the box plane to achieve essentially all of the induced drag savings that this configuration offers in particular extending the upper part of the box only 10 of the span inward from the tip achieves a span efficiency within about 1 of the complete box thus one could achieve the drag savings of the box plane without the reynolds number and fuel volume penalties of the two wing design furthermore the small horizontal tip extensions have some interesting implications for airplane design this section addresses the c wing concept in a bit more detail and focusses on the application to a large commercial transport design theoretical ideas application to large aircraft
c wing optimization c wing optimization and initial results studies at stanford and boeing were undertaken as part of nasaos advanced concepts program in 1995 concurrently initial sizing and optimization of the original concept were pursued at nasaos langley research center each of these studies involved analysis and numerical optimization of the basic concept at langley the flops computer program was modified to handle this geometry at stanford and boeing the pass and acsynt codes were also modified to analyze this design existing engine decks representative of modern high bypass ratio engines were used rather than estimating the performance of future technology this represents a rather conservative approach additional analysis with adp engines and laminar flow control remains to be completed but several aspects of the design suggest that gains from such technologies may exceed those obtained with conventional designs the figure below illustrates example results from one of these studies with the following assumptions design mission and constraints parameter langley boeing stanford range 7000 nmi 7000 nmi mach 0.85 0.82 passengers 800 600 tri class field lengths 12000 11000 engines 4 3 approach 150 kts other constraints typical of far part 25 the results indicate that substantial reductions in take off weight are possible even though the concept was aimed primarily at resolving some of the problems associated with very large aircraft rather than providing much better performance
c wing aerodynamics c wing aerodynamics the optimal loading of this lifting system is shown in the figure below the circulation of the main wing is carried onto the winglet so that the winglet is loaded inward when the horizontal extension is added to the winglet forming the c shape the circulation is extended from the winglet as well producing a surface that is loaded downward for minimum induced drag at fixed total lift it is only when the lifting surface is extended to the centerline to form a box plane that the upper wing can efficiently carry an upload this is because as mentioned previously in connection with closed systems we can superimpose a constant circulation ring on the closed system to redistribute the lift without changing the wake this download on the c wing horizontal surfaces affects structural weight and trim and the implications for aircraft configuration concepts was intriguing this configuration was independently discovered by a genetic algorithm that was asked to find a wing of fixed lift span and height with minimum drag the system was allowed to build wings of many individual elements with arbitrary dihedral and optimal twist distributions the figure below depicts front views of the population of candidate designs as the system evolves on the right the best individual from a given generation is shown
nonplanar wings introduction introduction nonplanar wings include configurations such as biplanes box planes ring wings joined wings and wings with winglets apart from configuration differences related to stability and trim variations in nonplanar geometry represent one of the few major differences in aircraft conceptual design such designs may be of interest because of their potential for lower vortex drag at a fixed span a key constraint for many aircraft including very large commercial transport concepts however several non aerodynamic features are of interest as well including effects on stability and control characteristics of wake vortices and structural implications of the nonplanar design this paper reviews some of the concepts that have been pursued and discusses some of their possible advantages or disadvantages we consider the potential of some of the concepts to improve performance incrementally or to change the configuration significantly nonplanar wing concepts may be divided into a few categories based on their primary geometric or aerodynamic characteristics these include multiplanes eg biplanes triplanes closed systems box planes ring wings strut braced systems lifting struts joined wings nonplanar monoplanes wings with winglets and other tip devices planar wings with nonplanar wakes crescent wings split tips
highly nonplanar lifting systems highly nonplanar lifting systems ilan kroo stanford university john mcmasters boeing commercial airplane group and stephen c smith nasa ames research center presented at transportation beyond 2000 technologies needed for engineering design nasa langley research center september 26 28 1995 abstract this paper deals with nonplanar wing concepts their advantages and possible application in a variety of aircraft designs a brief review and assessment of several concepts from winglets to ring wings is followed by a more detailed look at two recent ideas exploiting nonplanar wakes to reduce induced drag and applying a c wing design to a large commercial transport results suggest that potential efficiency gains may be significant while several non aerodynamic characteristics are particularly interesting outline introduction and background some results what is possible a closer look at two concepts exploiting nonplanar wakes a very nonplanar wing the c wing concept conclusions and postscript references
nonplanar wings results results what is possible each of these configurations provides particular advantages and disadvantages although each benefits from some reduction in induced drag compared with the conventional monoplane the reduction in vortex drag is shown below for biplanes boxplanes and winglets with varying ratios of height to span these results were computed using an optimizing vortex lattice code but agree with classical solutions from prandtl von karman and burgers cone and jones note that the boxplane achieves the lowest drag for a given span and height although winglets are quite similar considerable savings in induced drag are possible for a fixed span if large vertical extents are permitted of course adding vertical surfaces such as winglets add wetted area and weight due to higher bending moments while the weight of a cantilevered biplane is increased since for a fixed total area the chords and dimensional thickness of each wing are halved jones showed that with fixed integrated bending moment a rough indicator of wing weight winglets produced about as much drag savings as planar tip extensions more recent analyses using more realistic weight estimation methods have yielded similar results but with much a less broad optimum for some applications this discouraging result is not relevant since the aircraft must operate with a span constraint or because the structural arrangement is not simply analyzed the figure below illustrates the effect of nonplanar wing shape on span efficiency each of the geometries shown in front view below is permitted a vertical extent of 20 of the wing span each design has the same projected span and total lift the results were generated by specifying the geometry of the trailing vortex wake and solving for the circulation distribution with minimum drag so each of the designs is assumed to be optimally twisted this was done by discretizing the vortex wake and solving a linear system of equations for minimum drag with a constraint on overall lift similar results for a variety of shapes have been described by cone munk letcher jones and others the results illustrate the variability in span efficiency among these designs note the relatively small gain for the diamond shaped device and the wing with dihedral while the c wing shape achieves essentially the same drag as the boxplane
nonplanar wakes split tip nonplanar wakes the split tip from among this list of possible designs we choose two ideas to look at in a bit more detail the first concept is based on the notion that it is the shape of the wake not the shape of the wing that is important to the total vortex drag by sweeping the trailing edge of the wing sharply backward or forward and placing the wing at an angle of attack one may generate a wake shape that looks very much like the wake of a wing winglet combination the difficulty here is that we must twist the wing or create a planform shape that achieves the optimal load distribution that corresponds to this geometry moreover for reasonable wing planforms the amount of out of plane wake deformation is very limited for this reason the potential gains associated with crescent shaped wings or wings with highly forward swept trailing edges are very small about 1 or less unless the wing has a very low aspect ratio to exaggerate this effect a wing with the geometry shown below was created the idea here was to generate a shape whose potential span efficiency gain for a given amount of out of plane deformation was large based on the previous figure a split tip geometry for the wake was selected as a shape that could be generated by wake deflection and the wing planform shown below was investigated the figure shows the planform shape and the shape of the wake trace when the wing is at 9 degrees incidence based on this wake shape an induced drag savings of about 5 is possible when the wing is optimally loaded and more as the angle of attack is increased of course the wake does not trail from the wing in the streamwise direction and careful computation of rolled up wake geometry and inviscid drag shows that the effect of wake rollup is to roughly double the gain expected for a streamwise wake the 11 increment in span efficiency was significant and the concept was studied in more detail both theoretically and experimentally the figure below shows the computed wake geometry and wing paneling used to compute vortex drag with the high order panel code a502 two wings were constructed and tested at nasaos ames research center the first was an untwisted planform with an elliptical chord distribution unswept quarter chord line and an naca 0012 airfoil section the second wing of the same area and span also untwisted with a 0012 airfoil section incorporated the split tip geometry both models were designed to incorporate a sensitive internal balance so as to minimize support interference the figure below shows the ratio of lift to drag for each of these wings confirming the predicted lower drag of the split tip geometry to further confirm the theoretical predictions estimates of vortex drag and wake shape were compared from calculations balance data and a detailed wake survey from the wake survey an explicit estimate for the vortex drag can be obtained this value agrees well with the computed result and the balance data the results are intriguing and although the configuration was selected to exaggerate a particular effect rather than to serve as a good airplane wing its application to aircraft propellers and rotors is currently under investigation
nonplanar wings strut braced wings examples strut braced wings aircraft concepts that employ auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces as struts to improve both aerodynamic and structural efficiency have been studied extensively in joined wing designs below the horizontal tail sweeps forward and joins the main wing forming a strut the tail is then in compression reducing wing bending moments if the tail is large enough to be positively loaded some induced drag savings is achieved while if it is carrying a down load the closed loop feature of the system minimizes trim drag the concept was proposed by dr julian wolkovitch who conducted numerous system studies wind tunnel and flight tests of the concept see references he envisioned applications for general aviation see figure below uav's and commercial aircraft it has been studied by boeing as a radar platform and by nasa for application to medium range transports pfenninger's laminar designs with lifting struts exploit the nonplanar strut geometry primarily for structural weight and stiffness although some induced drag reduction may be achieved
nonplanar wings footnote getting there this is the result of a numerical optimization study undertaken during my 11 hour trip from san francisco to this conference
nonplanar wings nonplanar wakes devices examples nonplanar wakes the induced drag of a nonplanar system can be lower than that of a planar system of the same lift and span this is true even when the wing surfaces themselves are co planar but their vortex wakes are not examples of this phenomena include america's cup sailboat keels here the keel and rudder or twin keel surfaces are coplanar but due to the substantial leeway angle and longitudinal displacement of the two surfaces the wake downstream of the boat resembles that of a biplane system and the induced drag is reduced substantially crescent wings this phenomenon was postulated as the reason for the distinctive planform shape of some bird wings and fish fins although the effect is almost unmeasurable split tips this design was created to exploit the nonplanar wake geometry and is discussed in more detail in a subsequent section of this paper
nonplanar wings winglets and tip devices examples winglets and tip devices the most common contemporary nonplanar wing configuration is the wing with winglets as seen below on the mcdonnell douglas md 11 these surfaces do reduce induced drag for a given span as well as providing a means of quickly distinguishing the airplane from a dc 10 the md 11 design includes small downward winglets while the 747 400 employs a full chord single winglet and many other variations are possible a variant of the winglet concept the c wing is discussed later in this paper it involves adding a horizontal winglet extension a wingletlet and has interesting aerodynamic structural and control implications

welcome to ailun microarray gene expression annotation id conversion comparison server we have integrated three different microarray platform annotation methods into our system including probe sequences gene identifiers and annotation files from commercial companies geo is a public repository for high throughput gene expression proteomics data with more than 100 thousand samples which provides a great resource to integrate multiple studies for biomarker discovery the difficulty in data reuse lies with the mapping of probes to established gene identifiers which can change as annotations for the underlying sequences change the annotation changes in affymetrix arrays may be more significant since any probe in a probe set may change in annotation therefore microarray results need to be re evaluated periodically with the latest probe annotations ailun re annotates all gene expression proteomics data from geo by relating all probe ids to entrez gene ids once every three month enabling you to find data from geo and compare them from different platforms and species platform annotations adds the latest annotations to any uploaded probe gene id list file platform comparison compares any two platforms to find corresponding probes mapping to the same gene cross species mapping maps platform annotations to other species gene search finds deposited platforms and samples in geo that contain a list of genes gpl id search finds the gpl id geo platform id for your array you can also download the latest annotations files for all arrays and our comprehensive universal gene identifier table which relates all types of gene protein clone identifiers to entrez gene ids for all species our database was last updated on 4 30 2011 we have successfully mapped 54932732 individual probes from 385099 geo samples measuring 3519 geo platforms across 217 species copyright 2007 all rights reserved comments & questions to butte lab webmaster last updated on april 30 2011

placing pitonsi page 1 placing pitonsi ideally a piton should be inserted into a crack 1 2 to 3 of its length and driven hard to the hilt a ringing sound steadily increasing in pitch usually indicates a solid piton another test is to tap the hammer lightly against the side of the head of the pin if the piton d0esn t give and if the hammer bounces with a good spring it's probably good but these tests are not completely reliable expert climbers avoid trusting their luck to one piton no matter how tight it seems when there is a choice select a honizontal crack over a vertical right wrong a piton driven straight up or upward at an angle is not necessarily bad especially when it is long and driven well when placing a piton in a vertical crack make use of any variations in the shape of the rock to cradle the piton and hold it in place a slightly wider part of the crack which narrows above and below will hold a piton better than a flush crack or a part of the crack where the sides are both convex be alert to the character and formation of the rock rock which ap pears solid may be unstable avoid driving pitons behind loose flakes and blocks q tied off

mail andrsn andrsn stanford edu this is an experiment in generating documentation the linux freebsd area is one where quite a few people might have some information but not know everything thus a q&a with answers from different people might work to participate send a reply to this message unfortunately the option to quote the original message when it comes up seems no longer to be available answering some questions or adding questions with or without answers at the end of each answer add your name and email if you like or title position if you want to as a way to identify you as the contributor i ll post the results here and also send them to freebsd doc for consideration as a tutorial or whatever annelise anderson andrsn andrsn stanford edu questions can i install freebsd on the same hard drive as linux if i install freebsd on the same computer on which i ve got linux will linux lilo work can i share linux swap space with freebsd will i be able to mount linux file systems under freebsd can i run linux binaries on freebsd what about the ones i ve installed on linux can they be moved or run from freebsd are there any configuration files i should migrate from my linux installation to freebsd data files programming text files and so forth the command line doesn t seem to be working very well what's wrong you re used to bash and now you have sh or csh without your old configuration files install bash configure is adding users and establishing accounts able to su to root the same in freebsd as in linux what about the system and user crontabs same deal configuration files in etc primarily what's the same what's different dev different names for things otherwise same commands eg mount dump etc where device names are needed do gcc and cc work the same under freebsd as they do under linux can i play quake from freebsd does freebsd run elf binaries is that the right question other questions mail andrsn andrsn stanford edu
the freebsd pre login message how do you change the message that appears before the login prompt note option a under 2 was broken for a while but if the crypto sources are installed the version of telnetd that results doesn t allow 2a to work use 2b then 1 create a file with the message you wish to display say etc issue give it 644 permissions chmod 644 issue 2 option a open as root etc gettytab with a text editor and add to the section that says default if etc issue and save the file note that the entries are separated by colons and the section ends with a colon 2 option b instead of using if as in 2a add your message to the im variable and put a n after it for a newline you can do this before or after the other stuff which determines whether it will come before or after the line listing the operating system and so forth be sure you don t split the default line into more than one line use r n and t to format your message beware pico with its automatic wrap 3 you should not need to get gettytab reread by restarting init which you could do either by rebooting a last resort or sending init a signal to restart with kill 1 1 init is always process 1 note that you can t test by logging in from an existing prompt you need to test it from the outside or by using the command telnet localhost 4 you can also create a message attached to the p pc pc console entry in gettytab with an if etc issuemsg added to the next line that will show up internally 5 it's possible to use the fortune program to change the message in the issue or issuemsg when if works file by running a crontab job that calls a script that writes a new message to the file periodically the script would run the fortune program you can create your own data base as a file from which fortune can select a message see man fortune and man strfile annelise anderson andrsn andrsn stanford edu
