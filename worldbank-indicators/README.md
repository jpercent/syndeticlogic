Worldbank Indicators API
====================

World Bank indicators API in Clojure. The idea is to create a Rapid
Miner data operator in Clojure.

This code includes the World Bank API in Clojure and a Rapid Miner
data operator in Java, and the glue code to connect the them, but the
operator currently does not use the API.

Ultimately, the idea was/is to use the Rapid Miner GUI interface and
implement algorithms over Spark.  But this project is not currently
being worked on.
