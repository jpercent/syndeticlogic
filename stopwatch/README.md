Stopwatch
=====

A stopwatch records lap times as strings of the form "MM:SS:HS" where 
MM = minutes;
SS = seconds;
HS = hundredths of a second.
Write a script that:
  * Accepts two lap times passed as command line arguments.
  * Calculates their average
  * Outputs the result in the same string format to stdout ending with a newline.
  * Has the following naming convention: <initial><surname>_stopwatch.filetype
(eg. jsmith_stopwatch.sh)

For example, given the strings "00:02:20" and "00:04:40" the script would return "00:03:30".
