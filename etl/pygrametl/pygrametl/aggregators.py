"""A module with classes for aggregation.
   An Aggregator has two methods: process and finish.

   process(group, val) is called to "add" val to the aggregation of the set of 
   values identified by the value of group. The value in group (which could be 
   any hashable type, also a tuple as ('A', 'B')) thus corresponds to the 
   GROUP BY attributes in SQL.

   finish(group, default) is called to get the final result for group.
   If no such results exists, default is returned.
