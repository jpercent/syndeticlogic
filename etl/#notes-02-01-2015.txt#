Trying to figure which language to use for building systems at
GYK-Antler. Had problems at Comlinkdata with database connections,
particularly with regard to connecting to MS SQL Server.

Seems like Java might be the best choice due to the JDBC drivers it
supports. Looking into Jython too. But I'm weary of going in that
direction as I haven't done much research into how well Jython works.

Found a promising library written by Christen Thomson.
