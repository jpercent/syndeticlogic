The implementation of the Apriori algorithm is in Apriori.java and the test data-set is in AprioriTest.java; Transaction.java and TransactionTest.java are data-set setup helper classes - they are not used in the Apriori algorithm.  The solutions to the homework problems are in data-mining.pdf.  The javadoc files are in a subdirectory called apriori-doc.
