 * Used with Environment.scanLog to scan raw log entries.  An instance of a
 * class that implements this interface should be passed to
 * Environment.scanLog.
 *
 * <p><em>WARNING:</em> This interface is meant for low level processing of log
 * records, not for application level queries.  See the following
 * restrictions!</p>
 *
 * <p>Please be aware that raw log entries are passed to the scanRecord method.
 * It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that these records
 * represent valid records in a Database by performing queries such as
 * Database.get.  Be sure to take into account the following information about
 * records that are passed to the scanRecord method:</p>
 * 
 * <ul> <li>Records may be part of transactions that were aborted or never
 * committed, as well as part of committed transactions or not part of any
 * transaction (written non-transactionally).</li>
 * 
 * <li>Records may be part of the interval specified when calling scanLog
 * because they were written by the log cleaner as it migrates records forward,
 * and not written by the application itself in the specified interval.</li>
 * 
 * <li>For a given record, there may be multiple versions of the record passed
 * to scanRecord because multiple versions of that record were written to the
 * log.</li>
 * 
 * <li>For a given record, a deleted version of the record may appear before or
 * after a non-deleted version of the record.</li>
 *
 * <li>The cleaner must be disabled while this method is running.</li>
 *
 * <li>This method should only be invoked immediately after recovery and prior
 * to any updates to the Environment.</li> </ul>
